```
# Configuration
Make sure to have a 'Scripts' folder inside Win32/Win64(Depending on the Delphi compiled settings) and throw the Python script in there.

This configuration is not needed if you cloned the repository, since it is already structured.

You can also change the main .pas file 'uDownload.pas' to use the .py or .exe version of the script:

* .exe
```pascal
Script := 'Scripts\IGDWNLDR.exe -l ' + AResource + ' -x ' + FType;
ShellExecute(Application.Handle, 'open', 'cmd', PChar('/c ' + Script), Nil, SW_HIDE);
```

* .py
```pascal
Script := 'Scripts\IGDWNLDR.py -l ' + AResource + ' -x ' + FType;
ShellExecute(Application.Handle, 'open', 'cmd', PChar('/c ' + Script), Nil, SW_HIDE);
```
